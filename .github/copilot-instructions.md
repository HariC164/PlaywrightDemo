# Project-Specific Instructions

This is a Playwright Test automation project with TypeScript. The project follows these conventions:

- Tests are located in the `tests` directory with `.spec.ts` extension
- Page Object Models are in `tests/pages` directory
- Configuration is in `playwright.config.ts`
- Tests should follow the Page Object Model pattern
- Each test file should focus on testing a specific feature or component
- Use TypeScript for strong typing and better maintainability
